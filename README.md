# Binary-Image-Processing-for-Feature-Extraction
This project explores the transformation of grayscale images into binary formats using edge detection and thresholding. By focusing on techniques such as Canny edge detection and binary thresholding, the project shows how to prepare images for further feature extraction and analysis.
